/*
 * Problem Statement:
You are given an array of integers where each element represents the count of balls. Each ball has weights in increasing order starting from 1. For example:
The first ball has a weight of 1.
The second ball has a weight of 2.
The third ball has a weight of 3, and so on.
You need to take out
ùëò
k balls with the highest weights and calculate their total weight. If a weight has multiple balls, exhaust them before moving to the next lower weight.
